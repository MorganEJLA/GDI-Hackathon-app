This app is using the Three Card Spread which can represent the Past, Present and Future. 

When presented with your cards, use the following as a reference for reading the spread as related to your question. 

Past: This represents any past influences, that can either propel you or block you. Lessons learned or lessons that need to be revisted. 

Present: This represents you and environment. Where you are right now. 

Future: Outcome; the culmination of the energy of the first two cards. 


*** A Note on Reversals **

Reversals of the cards may appear in your spread. If you are familiar with tarot this may seem like a negative card. Fear not! Some interpret reversals as the shadow side of that card. The overall representation of the reversed tarot card is that it is just something to pay closer attention to. 

Example: The Temperance card is a card of balance. One of the interpretations when it's reversed is that the querent may be putting too much energy into one thing and not enough in others. It's just a reminder to think about if you are not maintaining some sort of balance and if you're not, getting back in balance may be something to consider!
