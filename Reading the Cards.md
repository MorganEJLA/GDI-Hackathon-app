This app is using the Three Card Spread which can represent the Past, Present and Future. 

When presented with your cards, use the following as a reference for reading the spread as related to your question. 

Past: This represents any past influences, that can either propel you or block you. Lessons learned or lessons that need to be revisted. 

Present: This represents you and environment. Where you are right now. 

Future: Outcome; the culmination of the energy of the first two cards.
